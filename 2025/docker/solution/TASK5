## Task 5: Manage Your Image with Docker Hub

### 1. Tag Your Image

#### What is Image Tagging?

Image tagging in Docker is a way to label an image with a meaningful tag, typically indicating a version or specific build. Tagging helps in identifying and managing different image versions efficiently.

#### How to Tag an Image

Before pushing an image to Docker Hub, it needs to be appropriately tagged. The format for tagging an image is:

```sh
docker tag <image-id> <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
```

#### Example:

Assume you have built an image named `sample-app:latest`. To tag it for Docker Hub:

```sh
docker tag sample-app:latest <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
```

This creates an alias `<your-username>/sample-app:v1.0` for the existing image.

#### Real-World Scenario:

Consider a development team working on a web application. They maintain different versions of their Docker images:

```sh
docker tag sample-app:latest myusername/sample-app:v1.0
```

Now, they can use version control to deploy older versions (`v0.9`, `v1.0`, etc.) if needed.

#### Best Practices for Tagging:

- Always use **semantic versioning** (e.g., `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`).
- Avoid using **latest** in production, as it can lead to unexpected version mismatches.
- Use **descriptive tags** like `stable`, `beta`, or `dev` for different environments.

### 2. Push Your Image to Docker Hub

#### Why Push an Image?

Pushing an image to Docker Hub allows it to be stored in the cloud, making it accessible from any system. This is useful for **team collaboration, deployment automation, and container orchestration**.

#### Step 1: Log in to Docker Hub

If you haven't logged in already, authenticate with Docker Hub using:

```sh
docker login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your **Docker Hub username** and **password**.

#### Step 2: Push the Tagged Image

Once authenticated, push your image to Docker Hub:

```sh
docker push <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
```

This command uploads the image to your Docker Hub repository.

#### Example:

A developer working on an application pushes the image to Docker Hub for easy access across multiple servers:

```sh
docker push myusername/sample-app:v1.0
```

Now, the image can be pulled and used on any machine or cloud provider.

#### Best Practices for Pushing:

- Use **private repositories** for sensitive applications.
- Regularly **remove outdated images** to free up storage.
- Implement **CI/CD integration** to automate image builds and pushes.

### 3. (Optional) Pull the Image

#### Why Pull an Image?

Pulling an image ensures that the uploaded image is accessible and can be downloaded onto any machine. Itâ€™s a great way to **validate the push process and deploy the image elsewhere**.

#### How to Pull an Image

To download the image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
```

This fetches the latest version of the specified image and stores it locally.

#### Example:

A new developer joins a project and needs to run the latest containerized application. Instead of setting up everything manually, they simply pull the latest image:

```sh
docker pull myusername/sample-app:v1.0
```

Now, they can immediately run the container without additional configuration.

#### Best Practices for Pulling:

- Always **verify the image source** before pulling.
- Use **specific versions** instead of `latest` to avoid unexpected updates.
- Scan images for **security vulnerabilities** after pulling.

---

### 4. Verify the Process

After pulling the image, verify that it's available by running:

```sh
docker images
```

You should see the image `<your-username>/sample-app:v1.0` in the list.

#### Example Output:

```sh
REPOSITORY                 TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
myusername/sample-app      v1.0       abc12345       5 minutes ago  50MB
```

This confirms that the image is successfully pushed and accessible from any machine.

#### Additional Verification Steps:

- Run the image using:
  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 <your-username>/sample-app:v1.0
  ```
- Check running containers:
  ```sh
  docker ps
  ```
- Stop and remove the container if needed:
  ```sh
  docker stop <container_id>
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

### 5. Summary Notes:

- **Tagging**: Assigns a version to an image for better tracking and management.
- **Pushing**: Uploads an image to Docker Hub for cloud storage and sharing.
- **Pulling**: Retrieves the image from Docker Hub to any machine for use.
- **Verification**: Ensures the image is successfully pushed and can be accessed from different environments.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use **descriptive and versioned tags**.
  - Secure images using **private repositories** where necessary.
  - Automate builds and deploys with **CI/CD pipelines**.
  - Regularly **scan images** for vulnerabilities.

This concludes Task 5, demonstrating how to manage Docker images using Docker Hub with **real-world scenarios, best practices, and practical examples**. ðŸš€
