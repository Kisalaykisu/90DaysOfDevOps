# **🚀 Understanding Kubernetes Architecture & Deploying a Sample Pod 🚀💡**

## **✨ Scenario**

Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes' control plane and worker node components, then deploy a simple Pod manually. Let's make Kubernetes easy and fun! 🎉

---

## **🔹 Steps to Follow**

### **1️⃣ Study Kubernetes Architecture 🏗️**

Kubernetes is composed of **two main layers**:

#### **🧠 Control Plane Components (Master Node) 🧩**

These components manage the cluster and handle scheduling, state maintenance, and configuration.

- **🛰️ API Server** – The **air traffic controller** of Kubernetes, processing all cluster requests and acting as the gateway for communication.
- **📍 Scheduler** – The **matchmaker**, assigning workloads (pods) to available nodes based on resource availability.
- **⚙️ Controller Manager** – The **watchdog**, ensuring the desired cluster state matches the actual state.
- **📚 etcd** – The **memory bank**, storing all cluster data like a distributed database.
- **☁️ Cloud Controller Manager** – The **cloud whisperer**, handling cloud integrations like load balancers and networking.

#### **🛠️ Worker Node Components 🔧**

Each worker node runs containers and communicates with the control plane.

- **🤖 Kubelet** – The **robotic manager**, ensuring containers are running as expected and reporting node health.
- **🐳 Container Runtime** – The **engine**, running containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).
- **🔀 Kube Proxy** – The **network wizard**, handling communication between pods and services.

📌 **Fun Fact:** The name "Kubernetes" comes from the Greek word **κυβερνήτης (kubernētēs)**, meaning **"helmsman" or "pilot."** 🚢

📌 **Things to Take Care Of:**

- Always ensure **etcd** has periodic backups since it stores all cluster information.
- The **API Server** is a critical component; if it goes down, Kubernetes becomes unmanageable. 🚨
- **Set resource limits** on pods to prevent unexpected resource exhaustion! ⚠️

### **2️⃣ Deploy a Sample Pod 📦**

To deploy a simple NGINX container using Kubernetes, follow these steps:

#### **📝 Create a YAML File (\*\***`pod.yaml`\***\*) 🗒️**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### **▶️ Apply the YAML File 🎯**

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

💫 This command creates an **NGINX pod** inside your Kubernetes cluster.

#### **🔬 Verify the Deployment 🕵️**

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

💡 If the pod is not running, check its status using:

```bash
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
```

📌 **Things to Take Care Of:**

- Ensure the **image is available** in the container registry.
- **Map ports correctly** if exposing the application externally.
- **Always check YAML syntax** before applying configurations.

### **3️⃣ Document Your Learnings 📖**

📌 **Describe Kubernetes Architecture:** Explain the roles of each control plane and worker node component.
📌 **Include your \*\***`pod.yaml`\***\* file:** Clearly explain each section of the YAML and its purpose.
📌 **Things to Take Care Of:** Always verify the **API version in YAML files** as it may change in newer Kubernetes versions! 🔃

## **💬 Interview Questions & Answers 📡**

### **1️⃣ How do Kubernetes control plane components work together?**

The **control plane is the brain of Kubernetes**:

- The **API Server** receives commands and directs traffic.
- The **Scheduler** finds the best node for each pod.
- The **Controller Manager** ensures that everything runs as expected.
- The **etcd database** stores all cluster state and configurations.
- The **Cloud Controller Manager** integrates cloud services.

Each worker node reports back to the control plane, and **Kubelet ensures that pods are running correctly**. 🚀

### **2️⃣ What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?**

- etcd is a **distributed key-value store** used by Kubernetes to maintain cluster state.
- It **stores configuration, node status, pod information, and cluster-wide settings**.
- If etcd goes down, the cluster loses its state and cannot function properly. **(Always back up etcd!)** 🔄🗄️

📌 **Things to Take Care Of:**

- Always configure **high availability** for etcd in production environments.
- Use **encryption and authentication** to prevent unauthorized access. 🔐

### **3️⃣ If a Pod fails to start, how would you diagnose the issue?**

Here are some troubleshooting steps:

🔹 **Check pod status**

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

🔹 **Describe pod details**

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

🔹 **Check logs for errors**

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

🔹 **Inspect events for failures**

```bash
kubectl get events
```

🔹 **Check node status**

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

💡 **Common Issues & Fixes:**

- ❌ **ImagePullBackOff** – The container image is missing or incorrect. Check image name.
- ❌ **CrashLoopBackOff** – The pod keeps restarting. Check logs for errors.
- ❌ **Pending** – No nodes available. Check `kubectl get nodes` for status.

📌 **Things to Take Care Of:**

- Verify that **container registry credentials** are correctly configured.
- Check if the pod has **sufficient resources** allocated.
- Ensure **network policies** allow communication if the pod relies on external services.

## **🎯 Conclusion 🎉**

You have now learned about Kubernetes architecture and successfully deployed an **NGINX pod!** Keep practicing to master Kubernetes fundamentals. 🚀💡

📌 **Final Things to Take Care Of:**
Always **check pod logs** for errors before troubleshooting other components. 🧐
Monitor **resource limits** (CPU, Memory) to avoid pod crashes. 📉
**Back up etcd regularly** to prevent catastrophic data loss! 💾⚠️
✅ Use **Namespaces** to logically separate workloads in large clusters. 🏷️
✅ Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict permissions properly. 🔒
✅ Enable **Liveness and Readiness Probes** for better pod health checks. 🔄
